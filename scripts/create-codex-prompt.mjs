## Time Passage + Status Freshness

Status timestamp: {{CREATED_AT}}
Source of truth checked: local Git snapshot attempt at registry path; verify actual root and origin
Last-known vs current: observed status only, not product or permission proof
Freshness risk: re-check required if time passes, another agent acts, user reports new activity, or approval/merge/apply/send/close is requested
Re-check required before: implementation start, validation claim, commit claim, push claim, PR claim, merge, apply, send, close, or completion claim

You are working inside the product repo listed above, not inside Gawain-Main.

## Mandatory Phase 0 — Existing-State + Context Check

Before changing files, inspect the current state relevant to this request.

You must identify:

- project / brand / workflow
- existing artifacts reviewed
- current behavior found
- working capability to preserve
- prior decisions and constraints
- conflicts found
- gaps / risks / assumptions
- smallest aligned implementation path

Do not implement from assumptions when current repo context, docs, tests, screenshots, packets, or prior decisions can be inspected.

Do not replace working functionality with a new abstraction unless the existing implementation is proven incompatible.

## Selective Intelligence and authority

Canonical skill: ~/.agents/skills/selective-intelligence/SKILL.md (verify installed source)
SI mode and trigger: not_evaluated
Selected review and evidence: not_evaluated
Current user or quorum authority: not_evaluated
Integration state: not_evaluated

Apply the installed canonical SI skill. Lean work is the default; select independent review or Guided Council only when its current triggers apply. This packet grants no new release authority.

## Rules

- Use only the target product repo path.
- Do not copy product source into Gawain-Main.
- Preserve unrelated dirty work; do not claim a clean checkout without inspecting it.
- Preserve working capability by default.
- Make the smallest aligned change that satisfies the approved goal.
- Return existing-state findings, files inspected, files changed, validation output, commit SHA, push status, and final git status.
- Return status timestamp, source of truth checked, last-known vs current, freshness risk, and re-check required before.
- Do not invent files, commits, validation output, metrics, production state, review status, or completion.
- Do not treat prior checks as current after meaningful time has passed.
- Share evidence only with an authorized reviewer and within the owning project's data boundary.
- Do not claim ready, approved, integrated, deployed, or complete beyond the exact observed proof and current authority.
