Worktree status: one pre-existing untracked REVIEW_RULES.old.md; left untouched

## Time Passage + Status Freshness

Status timestamp: 2026-06-13
Source of truth checked: local git status, RoundTable doctrine docs, lane templates, package scripts
Last-known vs current: current as of status timestamp
Freshness risk: re-check required before merge, send, apply, or live Discord activation
Re-check required before: merge, approval claim, live Discord env configuration, live Discord send, or Merlin activation

## Mandatory Phase 0 - Existing-State + Context Check

Project / brand / workflow: RoundTable doctrine and packet contract for Merlin Discord runtime bridge.
Existing artifacts reviewed: ROUND_TABLE.md, docs/REVIEW_PACKET_STANDARD.md, docs/LANE_INTAKE_STANDARD.md, docs/CODEX_HANDOFF_STANDARD.md, docs/MERGE_READINESS_STANDARD.md, lane-packets/roundtable/parent-routing-packet-runtime-storage-split/PARENT_ROUTING_PACKET.md, package.json.
Current behavior found: RoundTable already defines itself as routing, doctrine, and operating record. Parent routing packet already forbids runtime, Discord bot/API code, storage, and product behavior in RoundTable.
Working capability to preserve: RoundTable remains dispatcher, doctrine, packet, and ledger layer only.
Prior approvals / rejections / constraints: Merlin runtime bridge was approved after being kept in Merlin. Discord must not be activated yet.
Conflicts found: RoundTable is not currently listed as a repo key in registry/repos.json; this lane records RoundTable directly under lane-packets/roundtable without modifying registry.
Gaps / risks / assumptions: Gemini preflight remains required because this is authority doctrine. No live Discord env or send is authorized.
Smallest aligned next action: define canonical packet and authority contract only.
